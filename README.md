# Kernel SVM Practice

This repository contains an implementation of Kernel Support Vector Machine (SVM) for classification tasks. The implementation is inspired by the Kaggle tutorial by Prashant111: [SVM Classifier Tutorial](https://www.kaggle.com/code/prashant111/svm-classifier-tutorial).

## Features
- Understanding and implementing Kernel SVM
- Using different kernel functions (linear, polynomial, RBF, sigmoid)
- Data preprocessing and feature scaling
- Model training and evaluation
- Hyperparameter tuning

## Installation
To set up the environment, install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
Run the main script to train and evaluate the Kernel SVM model:

```bash
python kernel_svm.py
```

## Dataset
The dataset used for this practice is sourced from Kaggle or any public dataset with classification labels. Ensure the dataset is placed in the appropriate directory.
